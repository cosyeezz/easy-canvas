Usage: next [options] [command]

The Next.js CLI allows you to develop, build, start your application, and more.

Options:
  -v, --version                            Outputs the Next.js version.
  -h, --help                               Displays this message.

Commands:
  build [directory] [options]              Creates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information about each route.
  dev [directory] [options]                Starts Next.js in development mode with hot-code reloading, error reporting, and more.
  info [options]                           Prints relevant details about the current system which can be used to report Next.js bugs.
  lint [directory] [options]               Runs ESLint for all files in the `/src`, `/app`, `/pages`, `/components`, and `/lib` directories. It also provides a guided setup to install any required dependencies if ESLint is not already configured in your application.
  start [directory] [options]              Starts Next.js in production mode. The application should be compiled with `next build` first.
  telemetry [options] [arg]                Allows you to enable or disable Next.js' completely anonymous telemetry collection.
  typegen [directory] [options]            Generate TypeScript definitions for routes, pages, and layouts without running a full build.
  experimental-test [directory] [options]  Execute `next/experimental/testmode` tests using a specified test runner. The test runner defaults to 'playwright' if the `experimental.defaultTestRunner` configuration option or the `--test-runner` option are not set.
  internal [options] [command]             Internal debugging commands. Use with caution. Not covered by semver.
